## Business Intelligence Problem

In a highly competitive streaming market, Netflix must refine its content strategy to align with evolving audience preferences and outperform rivals like Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Disney+. Key questions addressed include:
- Which genres perform best?
- How does release year impact content success?
- Are movies or TV shows more engaging?
- What is the effect of content duration on viewer satisfaction?

Answering these questions helps Netflix allocate production resources effectively, maximize ROI, and boost subscriber retention.

## Types of Analytics Used

- **Descriptive Analytics**: Summarizing historical viewer engagement trends, genre popularity, and content performance using Power BI visualizations (heatmaps, scatter plots, line charts).
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasting future content success using Azure Machine Learning and Python regression/classification models integrated into Power BI.

## Datasets Analyzed

- Netflix Shows Dataset (Kaggle)
- User Engagement Metrics (TimeSpentMinutes, Likes, Comments)
- Financial Metrics (Ad Spend, Marketing Spend, ARPU)
- Subscriber Additions Dataset
- Streaming Time Dataset
- Content Spending Dataset

Data preprocessing included consolidation, cleaning, transformation, and reduction, ensuring a reliable and structured star-schema data model implemented in Power BI.

## Data Model and Architecture

- **Fact Table**: Metrics like Time Spent Watching, Likes, Comments, Streaming Time, and Ad Spending.
- **Dimension Tables**: Content attributes (Genre, Content Type, Release Year, Duration), User Engagement, Financial Metrics, and Time Dimension.
- **Architecture**: 
  - Data Warehouse (structured raw data)
  - Business Analytics (descriptive and predictive analysis)
  - Performance Strategy Layer (Power BI dashboards for stakeholders)

## Key Findings

- **Genre Insights**: Dramas and Comedies consistently achieve higher engagement.
- **Content Duration**: Viewer preferences vary by content length; shorter formats appeal to certain segments.
- **Content Type**: Both TV shows and movies offer value, but engagement patterns differ.
- **Release Trends**: Newer content (recent years) aligns with higher engagement and subscriber growth.
- **Predictive Models**: Forecast content success likelihood based on genre, type, and duration.

## Technologies Used

- Power BI
- Python (for data preprocessing and advanced visualizations)
- Azure Machine Learning (predictive modeling)
